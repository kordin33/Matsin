This folder contained an alternative JS Socket.IO server used historically for collaboration.

Status: DEPRECATED â€” the project now uses the TypeScript server in `excalidraw-room/` (at repo root), which matches the client event names and exposes REST endpoints.

Do not deploy this server. Point `VITE_APP_WS_SERVER_URL` to the TypeScript server instead.
